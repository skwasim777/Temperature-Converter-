# Temperature Converter

This is a simple web application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The application provides input fields for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, and it dynamically updates the other two fields based on user input.


## Usage
1. Open the 'index.html' file in a web browser.
2. Enter a temperature value in one of the input fields (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
3. The corresponding temperature values in the other two units will be automatically calculated and displayed.
## Files
- 'index.html': The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- 'style.css': The CSS file that provides styling for the web page.
- 'index.js': The JavaScript file that contains the logic for temperature conversion.
## How it Works
The temperature conversion is handled by the computeTemp function in the index.js file. This function is triggered whenever there is a change in the input fields. It performs the necessary calculations based on the selected input field and updates the other two fields accordingly.

The styling of the web page is defined in the style.css file, providing a visually appealing and responsive design.
## Styling
The web page has a simple and clean design with a background gradient. The temperature input fields have a monospace font, and the placeholder text is styled to provide a clear indication of the expected input.
